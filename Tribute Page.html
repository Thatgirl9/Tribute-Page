         <em> Edina Ukonu was a dynamic woman, she was very spontaneous. It was never a dull moment when she is around. A lot of fun memories of all the wonderful times we spent with her. At the age of 88 she could still get down to the sound of a beautiful music with her grandchildren and great-grands. She truly was a special woman!
